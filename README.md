## Model Providers

This template now uses the [OpenRouter API](https://openrouter.ai/) through the [`@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider). Configure your preferred model with the `OPENROUTER_MODEL` environment variable (defaults to `openrouter/auto`) and authenticate requests with `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. Each call automatically forwards the `APP_BASE_URL` and `APP_TITLE` headers recommended by OpenRouter.

With the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction), you can still switch to other providers as needed by adjusting the server-side integration.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file (or use `vercel env pull`) and supply the following values:

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: Required. Your OpenRouter API key (format `sk-or-...`).
- `OPENROUTER_MODEL`: Optional. Default model identifier to stream from (`openrouter/auto`).
- `APP_BASE_URL`: Optional. Public URL of your deployment, used for OpenRouter attribution headers.
- `APP_TITLE`: Optional. Title shown in OpenRouter's request logs.
- `STORY_SYSTEM_PROMPT`: Optional. Override the shared narrative system prompt used for every chat session.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the Next.js AI Chatbot to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-ai-chatbot)

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various AI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
npm run dev
```

(`pnpm dev` works as well if you prefer pnpm directly.)

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
